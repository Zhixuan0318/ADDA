Last-mile logistics represents the final phase in a complex industrial supply chain, where goods or products are transported from a distribution center or warehouse directly to the end consumer. This stage is crucial because it often serves as the only direct interaction a customer has with the supply chain, significantly influencing their satisfaction and overall experience. A smooth and efficient last-mile delivery process not only enhances customer perception but also strengthens brand reputation, offering a competitive edge in the market.
