## üí°Inspiration: The Agreement Trap in Last-Mile Logistics

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is last-mile logistic? Is it important?

![Frame 35 (3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e743ec7d-9c9b-48e2-948c-8922246f0f6b)

Last-mile logistics represents the final phase in a complex industrial supply chain, where goods or products are transported from a distribution center or warehouse directly to the end consumer. This stage is crucial because it often serves as the only direct interaction a customer has with the supply chain, significantly influencing their satisfaction and overall experience. A smooth and efficient last-mile delivery process not only enhances customer perception but also strengthens brand reputation, offering a competitive edge in the market.

### üï∏Ô∏èChallenges: Stuck in the Agreement Trap

Last-mile logistics involves numerous processes and requires various agreements to be settled at each stage, such as service agreements, service terms, proof of delivery, and acknowledgment of delivery. However, many industries continue to rely on traditional methods to manage these agreements, leading to what can be described as an **"agreement trap"**. This trap results in several challenges, includingüëá:

## üòïWhat's Impossible? Operational Transparency is Missing

### Docusign Only Focus on Document Transparency

DocuSign offers significant benefits in document transparency and streamlined agreement management in a last-mile logistics workflow, but not on operational transparency. DocuSign primarily focuses on creating clear, auditable trails for agreements and signatures. However, it does not inherently address the broader operational transparency of the logistics process itself. Critical operational data, validation, accountability for each step in the delivery process, and visibility into decision-making‚Äîremains outside its scope. And based on research, operational transparency is also important in last-mile logistic as it is a key success factor of industry supply chain.

This creates potential centralization issues üëá:

##### 1Ô∏è‚É£Lack of Real Time Context and Physical Validation

![Frame 39 (3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a49b4446-1fa9-4d95-8ea6-7525db71baa7)

Logistics processes mostly involve physical events, such as delivery execution, condition checks, recipient authentication, and proof of service completion. These activities require real-time context and validation to ensure accuracy and accountability. While DocuSign ensures secure and trackable digital agreement signing workflow, it cannot provide insights into physical conditions or immediate operational statuses during the distribution process (for example, physical condition verification).

##### 2Ô∏è‚É£Bad Actor Scenario Occurs

![Frame 37 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f88e972-c2d7-4bf2-8d2c-4ca69fffcda5)

Relying solely on DocuSign for last-mile logistics introduces vulnerabilities to bad actors, as it lacks mechanisms to address the complexities of physical validation and accountability. On the recipient side, bad actors could exploit the system by making fraudulent delivery claims or impersonating the intended recipient using fake identities. Similarly, on the logistics side, couriers might falsify delivery reports, claim to have shown up without doing so, or mishandle goods while concealing their actions. Without additional layers of validation or tracking, it becomes challenging to identify and mitigate these risks effectively, leaving the process susceptible to abuse.

##### 3Ô∏è‚É£Lack End-to-End Accountability in Large Network of Stakeholders

![Frame 36 (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7393982d-ac77-4fcd-985e-60956087cb23)

In supply chains with a large network of stakeholders, achieving transparency in the last-mile logistics phase becomes particularly challenging, especially when using a Docusign-based internal system. With so many different parties involved, managing who has access to what information can quickly become cumbersome and inefficient. An external solution is needed, such as a shared ledger concept database, provides an effective approach by offering a decentralized, tamper-proof record of key events and data associated with each logistics transaction. This ensures that all stakeholders have access to the same transparent, up-to-date information, reducing the risk of discrepancies and enhancing accountability across the entire logistics process.

> üìåüìåüìå **To conclude:**
> **Industries require an external mechanism that is inherently transparent and resilient against fraud and manipulation to combine with Docusign in order to facilitate the whole last-mile logistic workflow.**

## ‚ú®Everything Is Possible! Docusign x Blockchain-Based Setup

<hr>

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWhat is blockchain? How it helps?

Blockchain is a shared and decentralized ledger. It enables the secure recording and verification of transactions without the need for intermediaries. Its inherent characteristics, such as immutability, transparency, and tamper-resistance, make it particularly suited for storing critical events and data in last-mile logistics, including digital agreements. It act as a strong backbone to eliminate bad actors scenarios and providing all the validation on physical events. This suitability stems from blockchain's ability to act as a reliable chain of custody, which is essential for tracking and documenting the lifecycle of goods from their origin to final delivery. 

In last-mile logistics, a chain of custody ensures that every handoff, timestamp, and status update is recorded, providing a clear and indisputable audit trail. A blockchain-based setup enhances this workflow as it offers end-to-end accountability and traceability, which are invaluable in resolving disputes, as every action is tied to a verifiable stream of data, fostering trust between stakeholders. Additionally, integrating external systems for data exchange in last-mile logistics can be highly complex, particularly when incorporating role-based access control (RBAC). Blockchain simplifies this process by offering a secure, unified medium that eliminates the need for intricate integration layers, ensuring robust access control and data security, especially with a large network of stakeholders.

### üí™We now have a Chain of Custody, working with Docusign

![Frame 41 (5)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91701dc2-d118-496c-8b17-717b37bfc264)

Now we understand that setting up a chain of custody using a blockchain implementation can address issues of centralization and bad actors, while restoring the missing operational transparency. Taking a broader view, we can integrate DocuSign into our designed last-mile logistics workflow. As mentioned, DocuSign excels at maximizing document transparency within the digital agreement signing process. It provides a seamless experience for all phases of agreement signing in the last-mile logistics workflow, ensuring convenience for clients.

Once the agreements are successfully handled by DocuSign, copies of those agreements, along with all key data and events occurring throughout the workflow, are securely stored on the blockchain-based chain of custody in a tamper-proof manner. Conversely, when logistics operators need to trace a specific record or event in the future, they can do so effortlessly, as everything is transparently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring the data retrieved is always accurate and verifiable.With this setup, large networks of stakeholders participating in the supply chain can also subscribe to all events recorded on the blockchain, effectively providing an external shared ledger.

**While the system is promising so far, there are additional aspects that need to be considered to ensure the mechanism is complete and robust enough for real-world applications. That's why...üëá**
